### About the Game
Gold Finder is a game where the player tries to find a certain number of gold coins which are randomly placed in cells on the game board. The player taps on a cell to inspect it. If the cell contains a gold coin, then the gold coin is revealed. If there is no gold coin, then inspecting the cell triggers a scan which shows the count of hidden gold coins in the same row and column as the selected cell. This information allows the player to make smart choices about which cells to inspect. The goal is to find all the gold coins using the minimum number of scans.
